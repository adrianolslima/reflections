1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I needed to use different machines to work on a project at a time or when I worked on a project with more people.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So I can choose what and when to commit.
