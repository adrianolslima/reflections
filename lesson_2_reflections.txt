1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The changes in the files in that repository start being tracked. So that a directory became a git repository.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a space between the working directory and the repositry. It has the files that are going to be commited to the repository. The value it offers is the possibility of choosing what you want to commit.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	By checking the differences between what is in the stanging area e the last commit so a can commit only one logical change each time.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	When I needed to implement something that may cause problems to stable system. In this case I could branch the main line of development and test the new implementation without changing the system.
